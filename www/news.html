<ul>
<li><b>2020-04-03:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Objects like gold and rocks now stack.</li>
  <li>Added command to look at items on the current tile, keyed to
    <kbd>;</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Added drop command, keyed to <kbd>d</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Added pickup command, keyed to <kbd>,</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Added an inventory screen. Press <kbd>z</kbd> to access it.</li>
  <li>Various bug fixes and UI improvements.</li>
  <li>Known issues:
     <ul>
     <li>In-game messages are often ungrammatical. A comprehensive language
       module is currently in the works.</li>
     <li>Rocks sinking into water sometimes will get stuck and stop
       sinking.</li>
     </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-03-06:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Added very large last level.  This is intended to be a future long-term
    map, so you're not expected to complete it. But this version still allows
    you to complete and win the game, so kudos if you actually manage to!</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where rooms sometimes have multiple floors of different
    types where they're supposed to be the same.</li>
  <li>Added falling rock traps.</li>
  <li>Conical creatures are restored to their original 5 HP. Not so easy to off
    them now!  On the other hand, they now stop chasing you if you're out of
    sight, so you <em>can</em> still lose them if you maneuver correctly.</li>
  <li>Various bugfixes and improvements.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-02-14:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Add more story plot nodes. Now there's a sequence of gradually larger and
    more difficult levels.</li>
  <li>Conical monsters can now climb ledges.  Much harder to shake them off
    now!</li>
  <li>FOV is now implemented, along with player map memory. Now you cannot see
    areas of the map you've not been to yet by panning. Panning <em>will</em>
    show you your memory of previously-seen parts of the map; however be aware
    that your memory of what was there may not necessarily reflect its present
    state!</li>
  <li>In-game help screen will now page correctly if it doesn't all fit in your
    terminal. (Nevertheless, we <em>highly</em> recommend a terminal window
    with as high a resolution as you can manage in order to have an adequate
    view of your 4D surroundings!)</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-02-07:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>In-game tutorial to teach you the basics of 4D movement.</li>
  <li>Tweak sinking mechanics: should be more consistent now.</li>
  <li>Ladders no longer support weight if you fall on it.</li>
  <li>Various bug fixes.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-02-01:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Water has been added. Each new game will have a random chance of getting
    rooms submerged or partially submerged in water.</li>
  <li>Added in-game help screen. Press <kbd>?</kbd> to open it.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
