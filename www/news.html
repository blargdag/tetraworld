<ul>
<li><b>2020-12-18:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Added a high-score board that logs the outcomes of your games. Each time
    you die, quit, or win the game, an entry will be logged, and it will also
    show you your rank in the high-score board.</li>
  <li>Introduced a new water-dwelling creature. Very dangerous!</li>
  <li>Reorganized the current levels and tweak map generation parameters.
    Eliminate boring redundant levels, make existing levels more
    dangerous.</li>
  <li>Fixed stacking order of gold ore so that it's always visible among piles
    of less important items. Should eliminate the tedium of hunting for that
    last piece of gold hiding under a rock!</li>
  <li>New pre-alpha build!</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-11-13:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed a regression and a crash bug.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-11-12:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Streamlined UI and keyboard controls:
    <ul>
    <li>Equip/unequip/drop actions now unified into inventory view.</li>
    <li>Remapped inventory key to Tab.</li>
    <li>Simplified equip/unequip to single apply button in inventory view.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Implemented drowning mechanic.
    <ul>
    <li>You now have 8 units of air which is decremented each turn you spend
      underwater. Once your air runs out, you begin suffering drowning damage.
      Air is replenished upon returning to the surface of the water.</li>
    <li>Added scuba gear item. Equipping this item provides an extra 30 units
      of air for deep-diving. Air in the tank is replenished upon returning to
      the surface of the water.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Improved AI.
    <ul>
    <li>Conical creatures will avoid water if they can; shelled creatures are
      amphibious and can survive in both air and water. Not 100% there yet; the
      conical creature AI will panic if already in water and fail to find a way
      out, so they will drown easily.</li>
    <li>Creatures of different factions will now fight each other.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Fixed bug where gravity takes effect for an extra turn between every
    consecutive save/load.</li>
  <li>Improved UI to show HP/air in
    <span style="color:yellow">yellow</span>/<span style="color:red">red</span>
    when they run below 50%/25%, respectively.</li>
  <li>Reduced number of log messages for falling and other common, low-priority
    events.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-10-24:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed tutorial level to suppress locked door message once player has
    found and activated the switch to open the door.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-10-16:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Expanded tutorial level to explain climb-ledge action, switches and
    doors, and falling.</li>
  <li>Finished gravity bugfix for creatures that get stuck in midair. There
    should be no more such cases.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-10-10:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>New developmental build!</li>
  <li>Implemented event filtering and difference between visible and audible
    events. Now you will only see events that are visible to your character,
    or, if the event is not visible but audible, you will receive a message
    describing the sound. Audible events also have limited range; faraway
    events will not be perceived at all.</li>
  <li>Added decorative vegetation of two grades:
    <tt style="color:#008000">%</tt> sparse, which is mainly decorative, and
    <tt>%</tt> dense, which also blocks line-of-sight. Beware that sometimes
    gold ore might be obscured under vegetation, so be sure to examine
    everything closely!</li>
  <li>Major bugfix to gravity system that sometimes caused objects to get stuck
    in midair, or shelled creatures getting stuck on ladders.</li>
  <li>Various improvements to level generation algorithms.</li>
  <li><b>Known bugs:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>The gravity fix is not complete; there remains a rare case of conical
      creatures getting stuck in mid-air for 1 turn.</li>
    <li>Vegetation can fall through pit traps, knock you on the head, and roll
      around.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-09-25:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed terrain generation to reduce the number of ladders.</li>
  <li>Added a level featuring locked doors and levers.</li>
  <li>Reduced the number of redundant "you see ... here" messages.</li>
  <li>Added equip (<kbd>e</kbd>) and unequip (<kbd>r</kbd>) commands.</li>
  <li>Added a new slow-moving shelled creature that, if you defeat it, yields
    an item that grants protection against falling rock traps. (Don't forget to
    <kbd>e</kbd>quip it after picking it up, though!)</li>
  <li>Fixed various bugs.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-04-03:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Objects like gold and rocks now stack.</li>
  <li>Added command to look at items on the current tile, keyed to
    <kbd>;</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Added drop command, keyed to <kbd>d</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Added pickup command, keyed to <kbd>,</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Added an inventory screen. Press <kbd>z</kbd> to access it.</li>
  <li>Various bug fixes and UI improvements.</li>
  <li>Known issues:
     <ul>
     <li>In-game messages are often ungrammatical. A comprehensive language
       module is currently in the works.</li>
     <li>Rocks sinking into water sometimes will get stuck and stop
       sinking.</li>
     </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-03-06:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Added very large last level.  This is intended to be a future long-term
    map, so you're not expected to complete it. But this version still allows
    you to complete and win the game, so kudos if you actually manage to!</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where rooms sometimes have multiple floors of different
    types where they're supposed to be the same.</li>
  <li>Added falling rock traps.</li>
  <li>Conical creatures are restored to their original 5 HP. Not so easy to off
    them now!  On the other hand, they now stop chasing you if you're out of
    sight, so you <em>can</em> still lose them if you maneuver correctly.</li>
  <li>Various bugfixes and improvements.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-02-14:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Add more story plot nodes. Now there's a sequence of gradually larger and
    more difficult levels.</li>
  <li>Conical monsters can now climb ledges.  Much harder to shake them off
    now!</li>
  <li>FOV is now implemented, along with player map memory. Now you cannot see
    areas of the map you've not been to yet by panning. Panning <em>will</em>
    show you your memory of previously-seen parts of the map; however be aware
    that your memory of what was there may not necessarily reflect its present
    state!</li>
  <li>In-game help screen will now page correctly if it doesn't all fit in your
    terminal. (Nevertheless, we <em>highly</em> recommend a terminal window
    with as high a resolution as you can manage in order to have an adequate
    view of your 4D surroundings!)</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-02-07:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>In-game tutorial to teach you the basics of 4D movement.</li>
  <li>Tweak sinking mechanics: should be more consistent now.</li>
  <li>Ladders no longer support weight if you fall on it.</li>
  <li>Various bug fixes.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><b>2020-02-01:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Water has been added. Each new game will have a random chance of getting
    rooms submerged or partially submerged in water.</li>
  <li>Added in-game help screen. Press <kbd>?</kbd> to open it.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
