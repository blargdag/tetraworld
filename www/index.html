<h1><em>Tetraworld</em></h1>
<hr/>

<p>A roguelike game set in a 4D world where there are 4 macroscopic dimensions
of space.</p>

<p>(Not to be confused with 4D <em>space-time</em>, which is 3D space + 1D
time. What we have here 4D space, or, if you like, <em>5D space-time</em>: 4D
space + 1D time.  No, there is no time travel here, sorry.)</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Run the program from a terminal (cmd.exe on Windows). Run with <tt>-h</tt>
for a list of command-line options.</p>

<p>Currently there is only one option:</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>-S</tt>, <tt>--smoothscroll</tt></dt>
<dd>Controls the timing delay when scrolling up/down or ana/kata, in msec. The
	default is 80msec. If you find this too laggy, try a lower value, like
	<tt>-S60</tt> or <tt>-S40</tt>.  Or turn it off altogether with
	<tt>-S0</tt>, in which case up/down or ana/kata movement will not have
	any intermediate frames, which will make the game respond faster but
	may be harder for beginners to understand what's going
	on.<br/><br/>Note that this value is treated on a best-efforts basis;
	if your terminal is slow, there is not much the game can do about it.
	On Windows, <tt>-S0</tt> may be your best bet, since
	<tt>cmd.exe</tt> is dog-slow.</dd>

<h2>Basic instructions</h2>


<h3>Okay, just <em>what</em> am I looking at here?!</h3>

<p>You're looking at an attempt to represent 4D space on a 2D screen. :-P</p>

<p>Each trapezoidal blob of characters is a faux-isometric 2D slice of your
character's current 4D view. The central trapezoid is where your character
is currently at, and the vertical column it's in is a 3D slice of the 4D
view. All the columns taken together are the 3D slices that make up the 4D
chunk of the world you're in.</p>

<p>The various characters have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>

<dt><tt>/</tt></dt>
<dd>Walls that you cannot pass through.</dd>

<dt><tt>#</tt></dt>
<dd>Unrevealed area of the map you've not been to yet.</dd>

<dt><tt>, : ;</tt></dt>
<dd>These characters represent different types of floor. In this version,
different types of floor do not yet have any difference in function.</dd>

<dt>~</dt>
<dd>Water. In this version, you can freely swim through water, and will not be
subject to gravity while in water.</dd>

<dt>(blank)</dt>
<dd>Blanks represent empty space that you will fall through.</dd>

<dt>&</dt>
<dd>Your player character.</dd>

<dt>-</dt>
<dd>Doorways that you can pass through.</dd>

<dt><tt>=</tt></tt></dt>
<dd>(Part of) ladders that you can climb.</dd>

<dt><tt>_</tt></tt></dt>
<dd>Top of a ladder.</dd>

<dt>$</dt>
<dd>Collectible gold ores. In this version of the game, you're supposed to
collect all the gold in the level and then find and activate the exit
portal.</dd>

<dt>@</dt>
<dd>The exit portal. Activate this after collecting all the gold in order to
finish the level.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Furthermore, in order to help you get your bearings in a 4D world, tiles
that lie along the 8 cardinal directions in 4D from your current location are
highlighted. This is particularly important when aligning yourself across
display columns.</p>


<h3>Navigating your environment</h3>

<h4>Gravity(!)</h4>

<p>As if moving around in 4D space wasn't already hard enough, this game also
has <em>gravity</em>, of the 4D variety.  That is to say, there is a designated
vertical direction, conveniently represented on screen vertically, along which
gravity acts.  For your convenience, we call the direction in which gravity
pulls <q>down</q>, and the opposite direction <q>up</q>, and the on-screen map
is drawn such that they correspond with the familiar <q>up</q> and <q>down</q>
directions on your screen.</p>

<p>Therefore, objects that are not supported from beneath in the <q>down</q>
direction will fall downwards under the action of 4D gravity, until it lands on
something solid.  So moving up/down will only be effective if you're standing
on a ladder; otherwise, moving down will accomplish nothing (you cannot pass
through the floor), and moving up will make you jump up but you will
immediately fall down again, (no) thanks to 4D gravity.</p>


<h4>Horizontal directions</h4>

<p>Perpendicular to the vertical dimension of gravity are 3 other dimensions
that constitute the horizontal directions: this being 4D space, there are 3
leftover dimensions after you exclude the vertical, so there are not 2, but 3
pairs of perpendicular horizontal directions. Accordingly, the floor surface
has 3 dimensions (and has an <em>area</em> that's measured in <em>cubic</em>
units&mdash;so we speak of cube footage in 4D rather than square footage!).
Thus, the <em>row</em> of 2D trapezoidal isometric slices underneath your
character, taken together, constitute a 3D slice where the floor is.</p>

<p>Which means there are <em>three</em> pairs of horizontal directions you can
move in: in addition to left, right, forwards, and backwards, we have to add a
new pair of directions: <em>ana</em> and <em>kata</em>.  If we include up/down,
that gives us 4 pairs of perpendicular directions to move it, which is why we
need 8 movement keys!</p>


<h4>Ledges</h4>

<p>Besides climbing ladders and moving over a flat surface, you also have a
special combo move: climbing a 1-tile-high ledge. If you're standing next to a
wall tile, and the tile on top of that is not another wall, moving in the
direction of the wall will initiate a 2-step combo move where you climb up the
wall onto the space on top (ala <em>Prince of Persia</em>). Thus, it is
possible to climb up to a doorway that isn't level with the floor, but 1 tile
above it.  This move can be useful for escaping certain scrapes if your pursuer
is unable to climb ledges.</p>

<p>On the other hand, such ledges can sometimes be easily overlooked, so be
sure you don't miss them when exploring!  To help with this, tile positions
that could function as ledges from your current location are highlighted in
blue along with the tiles along the cardinal axes. These highlights lie one row
above where your character currently stands. If you see a floor tile or doorway
highlighted this way, it means you're standing next to a ledge and can climb it
by moving in the direction of the wall immediately below it.  Which also means
that if you see a floor or doorway tile that looks like it might line up with
the blue highlights if you move a little, it's probably also a ledge, and it
might be worthwhile to try to reach it, as it might lead somewhere
interesting.</p>


<h4>Map features</h4>

<p>The current version of game only generates maps that consist of
rectangular<sup>*</sup> rooms connected by doors, ladders, the occasional pits
(watch out for holes in the floor!), and even hidden trapdoors. There may be
rooms submerged or partially submerged in 4D water. Have fun!</p>

<p>(<sup>*</sup> Technically, <em>hypercuboidal</em>.)</p>

<p>In later versions, you may encounter other types of maps as well.</p>

<p>There are also native 4D creatures that you're likely to run into. In this
version of the game, they are always hostile, and therefore should be avoided!
You will know them when you see them: they move and chase after you!</p>


<h2>Controls</h2>

<p>Currently, only keyboard controls are supported. Mouse support is planned,
but currently not yet implemented.</p>

<dl>

<dt>?</dt>
<dd>The most important key of all, this shows the in-game help screen that
	describes the various controls.</dd>

<dt>h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o</dt>
<dd>Movement keys.  These keys were chosen to approximate the movement
	direction they represent on-screen, at least on Qwerty layout keyboards
	(Dvorak layout support will eventually be included).  So:

	<dl>
	<dt><tt>i</tt>, <tt>m</tt></dt>
	<dd>move in the vertical direction (up/down);</dd>

	<dt><tt>h</tt>, <tt>l</tt></dt>
	<dd>move left/right across columns (ana/kata, or if you're used to Vi
	keys, you could also think of it as left/right, it's just one of the
	horizontal directions after all);</dd>

	<dt><tt>j</tt>, <tt>k</tt></dt>
	<dd>move left/right within a column (left/right, or if you're a Vi
	person, <q>up</q>/<q>down</q>: imagine the floor as a slice of the 3D
	universe laying <q>flat</q> on a 4D surface such that what we 3D folk
	think of as up/down is now an extra pair of horizontal directions
	instead);</dd>

	<dt><tt>n</tt>, <tt>o</tt></dt>
	<dd>move backwards/forwards within an isometric slice (think of it as
	being perpendicular to your computer screen, isometrically projected to
	be diagonal).</dd>
	</dl>

<dt>H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O</dt>
<dd>Keys for panning the current 4D viewport around without moving your player
	character. These keys directly correspond with the movement keys, but
	instead of moving the player character they pan the 4D viewpoint only.
	Useful for looking around at your surroundings without spending your
	turns (which may be fatal when enemies are around!).<br/><br/>Better
	yet, in this version of the game FOV is not implemented yet, so you can
	actually view the entire level this way (if you can wrap your head
	around the 4D layout :-P).  To re-center the viewport on your player
	character again, press space.</dd>

<dt>(space)</dt>
<dd>Recenter the 4D viewport on the player character. Useful after you've moved
	the viewport with <tt>H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O</tt>.</dd>

<dt>p</dt>
<dd>Pass a turn. Can be useful in tactical movement around enemies.</dd>

<dt>(enter)</dt>
<dd>Activate an object in the tile you're standing on. Currently only useful
for the exit portal.</dd>

<dt>q</dt>
<dd>Save current game and quit. The game will automatically continue where you
left off the next time you start the program. <strong>Warning:</strong> always
exit the game with 'q' if you want to keep your current character; if the game
terminates for any other reason, you will permanently lose your character.
Welcome to permadeath.  :-D</dd>

<dt>Q</dt>
<dd>Delete current game and quit. <strong>Warning:</strong> once deleted, it is
impossible to get your character back.</dd>

</dl>


<h2>How to win</h2>

<p>In this version of the game, you have to find and collect all of the gold
ores scattered around each level, then find the exit portal and activate
it. Currently, there is only one level after the initial tutorial. In future
versions more will be added.</p>

<p>The challenge, of course, is navigating the 4D geometry of the level and
locating the gold. Fortunately, barring a bug in the map generator, the current
version of the game always generates maps that are <em>connected</em>: you will
always be able to reach all parts of the map from any part, even if you stumble
into hidden pits and fall through.  So you can rest assured that you will never
get stuck without a way out, even if you do get totally lost in 4D space.
:-D</p>

<p>There are also enemies that you may run into (you will know them when you
see them!).  In this version of the game they are pretty dumb and predictable;
they will always try to home in to your location, and have a tendency of
falling off ladders if appropriately lured. With some practice you should be
able to lose them as long as you have access to a ladder.  They are also poor
swimmers and tend to get stuck at the bottom of pools; if you can lure them
into one it will relieve you of them for a while.</p>

<p>Be careful that what is adjacent in 4D may not be displayed adjacently on
the screen, and these enemies are native to 4D space and facile with moving
around in 4D, so you should always double-check exactly which tiles are
adjacent to an enemy before making a move!</p>
