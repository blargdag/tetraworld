Oh yes, still more detritus from 4D obsession.

Motivation:
- D's compile-time introspection makes it actually possible to write
  world-level objects as D classes! Isn't that awesome?!
- We can probably even auto-serialize using this trick too! No need for flaky
  fragile wrappers and hacked parse scripts to generate code from hand-made
  unreliable templates; just write straight D code and use introspection to
  auto-serialize stuff. Whoa! D just acquired whole new levels of cool!

Mapgen ideas:

- Tiered map generation:
   - First n levels of BSP tree can be used for generating large-scale
     topological features, such as disjoint regions connected by locked doors.
   - Middle levels of BSP can be used for thematic regions, like different
     terrain styles, vertically-oriented regions with largely climbing-related
     play styles, experience-oriented regions / mini-puzzles/challenges.
   - Lowest levels of BSP are individual rooms.
