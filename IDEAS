Oh yes, still more detritus from 4D obsession.

Motivation:
- D's compile-time introspection makes it actually possible to write
  world-level objects as D classes! Isn't that awesome?!
- We can probably even auto-serialize using this trick too! No need for flaky
  fragile wrappers and hacked parse scripts to generate code from hand-made
  unreliable templates; just write straight D code and use introspection to
  auto-serialize stuff. Whoa! D just acquired whole new levels of cool!
