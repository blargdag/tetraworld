- Implement save/load.
   - Should probably turn Vec and Region into mixins instead of isolated types,
     so that we can unify Vec with Pos and make Region more nicely
     serializable.
- Should probably implement gravity now rather than later, since it changes a
  LOT of things.
- Map underlying representation should be distinct from dchar.
   - The dchar view should be via a MapTile proxy object that maps underlying
     game objects into printable tiles.
- Subdisplay of subdisplay should bypass the intermediate layer of SubDisplay
  and connect directly to the bottom layer display.
- Subdisplay .writef method should perform clipping(?).
X Implement .dim and .pos for Rectangle.
+ Unify Rectangle with Vec?
+ [bufdisp] Implement subline flushing.
+ [bufdisp] Support color.
