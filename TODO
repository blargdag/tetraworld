- Implement session recorder.
- Implement message() batching and --MORE-- prompt.
- Add water level, underneath which free movement is possible? :-D
   - But it will require finding an oxygen mask... Well, OK, this is 4D, so
     "oxygen" doesn't make sense. Maybe call it "diving equipment"?
- Implement FOV and player map memory.
- Improve creature AI.
   - Pathfinding.
- Subdisplay of subdisplay should bypass the intermediate layer of SubDisplay
  and connect directly to the bottom layer display.
- Subdisplay .writef method should perform clipping(?).
X Implement .dim and .pos for Rectangle.
+ Unify Rectangle with Vec?
+ [bufdisp] Implement subline flushing.
+ [bufdisp] Support color.
+ Implement save/load.
   P Should probably turn Vec and Region into mixins instead of isolated types,
     so that we can unify Vec with Pos and make Region more nicely
     serializable.
+ BUG: tile colors are DIFFERENT across Windows/Posix; so you really should not
  save any tile colors in the save file, you should be using generic tile IDs
  that map to actual tiles in a separate module (that has proper per-platform
  values initialized! -- though that part is taken care of by arsd.terminal,
  you just have to separate it from the savefile).
+ Should probably implement gravity now rather than later, since it changes a
  LOT of things.
+ Map underlying representation should be distinct from dchar.
   + The dchar view should be via a MapTile proxy object that maps underlying
     game objects into printable tiles.
+ Need to refactor play() and separate out the UI code from the game engine
  code.
+ Make climbing up ledges animatable.
+ Implement NPCs / moving creatures!
+ Implement "smooth" scrolling in vertical / ana/kata directions. Probably
  *very* necessary for new players to even understand what's going on.
