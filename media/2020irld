[2020 in RoguelikeDev] Elephant! and Tetraworld

**Elephant!**

An African elephant simulation game, in which you play the role of an African
elephant trying to survive in the wilderness. Core mechanic is survival and
navigation: finding food, water, and minerals in a harsh wilderness, surviving
predators and poachers, managing other herd members, and rising in rank in
elephant society.


**Tetraworld (working title)**

A roguelike set in 4D space, where the map occupies not 2, not 3, but 4
dimensions of space. Features 4D gravity, which adds a whole new dimension(!)
of interest in map generation, movement mechanics, and exploration.  The core
mechanic is exploration and tactical maneuvers.


**2019 Retrospective**

These projects have been around for years but have been sitting on the
backburner collecting dust, until late 2019 when I stumbled across
/r/roguelikedev and the Roguebasin articles, which inspired me to start with a
narrower scope and get a core working game first, instead of reaching for the
skies but never getting out of the well.

So I started working on *Elephant!* again.  Before this, there was only a bunch
of E's (for **e**lephant) moving around randomly on a featureless map, but
within a few months I had an actual game loop, a semi-nice ASCII UI, xterm
256-color mode, an ECS system (or rather, an EC store), a plot, the beginnings
of an AI system that has herbivores seeking for and eating food and carnivores
hunting and eating prey, and a preliminary win condition.  Pretty good progress
for a spare-time hobby!

The end of 2019 saw a pause in *Elephant!*'s development, however, due to
getting stuck in over-engineering a complicated AI action system that may or
may not be warranted at this point.  Out of frustration, I turned to
Tetraworld, another backburner project that had been collecting dust for years.

Tetraworld was actually an attempted rewrite of an even older 4D maze game I
wrote more than a decade ago. Before I started working on it again in December,
it only had a tiny single-room map and the player character moving around with
nothing to do; not even the viewport moved with the player, and it would crash
when the player moved out of view.  Thanks to lessons learned from the
*Elephant!* project, however, and thanks to liberally borrowing from
*Elephant!*'s codebase (hence my SS jokes about pachyderms leasing out their
code), within a month Tetraworld has expanded by leaps and bounds, and now has
a BSP-tree based mapgen, gravity, a ladders-and-pits exploration mechanic,
collectible plot tokens, a win condition, rudimentary monsters, nice ASCII
animations for vertical and ana/kata movements, and just this week, an ability
to record sessions that can be replayed by another tool I wrote called
`playterm` (a reinvention of ttyrec but with an editable text format, that can
also render into animated gif format using libfreetype and ImageMagick).


** 2020 Outlook **

This year, the hope is resume work on *Elephant!* and produce an MVP (minimum
viable product).  While *Elephant!* and *Tetraworld* are drastically different
games, in terms of code they have been feeding off each other, and I've learned
a lot from working with Tetraworld's code; this has given me a much better idea
of how to get through the current impasse in *Elephant!*.  I had planned for an
MVP by December 2019, but clearly that was *far* too ambitious.  :-D  The
saying is true, that writing a roguelike is *far* more complex than it first
appears!

For Tetraworld, this year's plan is to adapt the rudimentary plot I'd written
for the ancient version of the game, add interesting items to aid 4D
exploration, and make it something nice and playable from start to finish.  The
most exciting things I'm looking forward to are:

* More interesting terrains, in particular, "4D water" (for lack of a better
  term!) where the player gets full degrees of freedom in movement, no longer
  constrained by gravity. This will drastically change the exploration
  mechanic, and I think will be very interesting!

* Simulating 4D ecosystems, where the mapgen will run short simulations so that
  the generated levels will feel "lived in".  Things like water flow in 4D,
  creatures and ecosystems that spring up around it, etc., will be extremely
  interesting, because in 4D there are certain novel characteristics that
  cannot be found in 3D, and it will be great fun to explore them in the
  context of a roguelike!

* Generating a 4D city: eventually there will be a city where the player can
  setup a home base of sorts. The plan is to have this gradually grow from a
  bare minimum settlement into a full-fledged thriving city as the player
  progresses.  It won't be a city sim -- that's not the goal of this game --
  but the player's actions will have consequences on the city, which in turn
  has consequences for the availability of resources for the player. Again,
  there are novel characteristics about 4D that will have dramatic consequences
  on the structure of a city, so this will be extremely interesting to explore.
